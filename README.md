# Folder-Structure-Viewer Project (Back-End)
## I've tried building this folder-structure viewer with React, MongoDB and Node js, I couldn't finish the project on time due to limited time and not having the practice of backend development for sometime now. However even after the time is finished I'll try to finish this project as it seems like  a fun little app and I'm getting to learn quite a lot by working on this project.

# To run this project clone the project first then use npm install to install necessary dependencies then run the `nodemon` script in the terminal, just type nodemon and hit enter, the script will take care of it.
